# SimchaFundEF

This is an application that organizes a Simcha Fund using Entity Framework Core. 
Each contributor can add a deposit, choose which simchas they'd like to contribute to, 
and has a history that displays a record of the contributor's deposits and contributions.

To get the project up and running:
In your command line, navigate to the SimchasEF.Data folder. 
Once in the correct folder, type dotnet ef database update in the command line. 
This will create a database in SQL Server and then the project will be able to run.
